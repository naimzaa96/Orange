# IST 707 â€“ Data Analytics

## Class Goals: To extract knowledge from data through:
- the ability to develop and employ technical solutions and designs from data analytics needs
- applying concepts and relevant algorithms to evaluate real-world problems and datasets
- articulating patterns and tell compelling stories from the data
- validating the source and end result

## Final Project

At the end of the course, I chose to incorpate the above goals into a common issue in cardiology: Understanding and predicting heart disease. The final report goes into more detail on outlining my investigation and results.

### Methods & Research:

Data was provided from the University of California Irvine's machine learning repository. 

Data preparation, interrogation and analysis was done in the RStudio.

External reasearch on cardiology and epedimiology was needed to understand key terms and human body processes' that promote angina, and cardiac arrest.
